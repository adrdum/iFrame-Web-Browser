iFrame Web Browser is a set of controls for an iframe, therefore allowing you to browse the web in a web page. Very meta.

OVERVIEW
--------

This is just a little project that I did on the side. The controls are pretty good, except that Google does not allow itself to be displayed in an iframe. If anyone could help me figure out how to determine screen size, that would be great. I could do without the 'Set Size' button.
